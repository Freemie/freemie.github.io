# freemie.github.io

My personal portfolio site, hosted on GitHub Pages.

I built this using plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks) so I can fully explain each part.  
Projects are stored in `projects.json` and rendered dynamically with JavaScript so I can add new projects without editing the HTML.

## Features
- Dynamic project cards (loaded from JSON)
- Client-side search (filters title/description/tags)
- Light/dark mode toggle (saved in localStorage)

## Live site
